excerpt: I solved this by just pinning react-markdown to version 6. With version 7 of react-markdown they moved to ESM only. There's a explanation of what that means here, but it seems Jest (version 27) still only has experimental support for pure ESM modules as of October 2021. I couldn't get it to work in my project, and version 6 of react-markdown works fine for now.
